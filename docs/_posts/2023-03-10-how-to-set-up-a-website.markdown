  Degrading or Liberating: 
  <small class="text-muted">Exploring Prostitution in San Francisco between the years of 2010 and 2017</small>
</h3>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <p class="lead">Prostitution has historically been a longstanding cultural, social, and political issue in San Francisco (SF). Sex workers have long fought for more rights, and for the decriminalization of prostitution through efforts such as Proposition K<cite>[1]</cite>, a measure aiming to prevent the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) from enforcing state prostitution laws and investigations into undocumented sex workers. On the other hand, initiatives such as the 2005 federal investigation entitled Operation Gilded Cage<cite>[2]</cite> and The Polaris Project<cite>[3]</cite> have investigated massage parlors for suspected sex services and human trafficking. In 2018, the SFPD adopted the ‘Prioritizing Safety for Sex Workers’<cite>[4]</cite> policy, preventing sex workers from getting arrested for prostitution when reporting crime.

  <p class="h5">A brief overview on SF Crime Dataset</p> 
    <p class="h6">The insights in this article are based on San Francisco Crime Data<cite>[5]</cite> from 2003 to 2017. The data is from the ‘Public Safety’ category and each row of the dataset is an Incident Report published by the SFPD. The dataset contains details of each crime incident, including details such as crime category, description, date, time, district, and day of the week.</p><br>

  <p>While prostitution in SF remains the subject of discussion, debate, and policing, prostitution-related crimes have decreased significantly from 2003 onwards. In 2003, there were 1937 incidents recorded, and in 2017, this number fell to 523, indicating a 73% decrease. This is likely due to increased efforts within law enforcement to combat prostitution, through increased police presence, federal investigations, and SFPD crackdowns. Other likely factors include improved economic conditions resulting in lower demand for prostitution. Increased collaboration between the SFPD and SF’s Department on the Status of Women<cite>[6]</cite> (a department working to ensure that women have equal rights and opportunities) contributes towards efforts to lower prostitution. Analyzing the data between 2003 and 2017, and comparing to crimes related to sexual abuse and potential human trafficking, we can see that Prostitution (73%) has the second largest percentage decrease behind Loitering (81%). Other statistics show a 36% decrease in Kidnapping and a 55% decrease in Disorderly conduct, a 96% increase in Forcible sex offenses, and a 72% increase in missing persons.</p>
   
  <p>The next part of the analysis dives deeper into prostitution in recent years, by looking at the data between the years 2010 and 2017. In 2010, there were 1281 prostitution-related crimes, this number fell to 449 in 2014 and 370 in 2015, the latter of which is the lowest recorded in the dataset (between 2003 and 2017). The calendar plot visualizes the progression and differences in recorded prostitution over the years. The earlier years between 2010 and 2013 have between 0 and 25 crimes recorded per day. In the years between 2014 and 2017, there are fewer than 5 instances recorded per day, but there are many days with between 25 and 45 instances recorded. This indicates that in the years between 2010 and 2013, there are more days with incidents, but fewer incidents per day, while in the years between 2014 and 2017, there are fewer days with incidents but a higher number of incidents per day. This alludes to the likelihood of more incidents per day being a result of police investigations and crackdowns where many incidents may be counted on a specific day.</p>

 <p>An FBI crackdown on the sex trade during the 2016 super bowl week<cite>[7]</cite> resulted in the contact/arrest of 129 prostitutes. This coincides with the spike in incidents during the week leading up to the super bowl, and the incidents on Thursday, February 4 depicted on the calendar plot. In the previous weeks, specifically January 29 and 23 as seen on the plot, there was also an increase in incidents, likely due to police crackdowns and the increase of activity due to the upcoming Super Bowl which was held on February 7, 2016, in the SF Bay Area. The aforementioned article<cite>[8]</cite> describes that such events often attract large crowds and an influx of activity which become profitable opportunities for sex trafficking-related endeavors, and potentially the case for increased prostitution-related activity.</p>

 <p>A CBS SF news article<cite>[9]</cite> dated October 20, 2016 details the arrest of an Oakland police officer based on charges of engaging in prostitution and obstructing justice. The article states that the police officer warned a prostitute of a police crackdown on the nights of October 13 and 14. The calendar plot shows Thursday, October 13 to be one of the days with the highest number of reported incidents, likely due to the police crackdown. Further evidence of this is an FBI operation aiming to end child sex trafficking in the Bay Area spanning six counties, including SF, titled Operation Cross Country X<cite>[10]</cite>, which was carried out from October 11 to 15, 2016. Amongst other statistics, the operation resulted in the arrest/citation of 135 adult women and 63 adult men associated with prostitution. Analyzing data from the day of the week, Thursday appears to be the day with the most recorded crime with 1525 instances, and Sunday is the day with the least recorded crime with 399 instances. This corresponds with the date of federal and SFPD crackdowns being on weekdays, specifically Thursdays, leading to most arrests on weekdays when law enforcement is on duty.</p>

  <p>Prostitution is most active at night time in SF, after the hours of 18:00 when there is less activity in public and more opportunity for people seeking surreptitious entertainment or getting involved in undercover activities. Based on the nature of the crime, there might potentially be a correlation between loitering and prostitution since most prostitution charges (3013 instances) are recorded in the dataset with the description ‘Loitering for purpose of prostitution’, however, the data proved this to be untrue. Loitering is most common in the morning between 05:00 and 09:00, and less common as the day progresses, while prostitution is least common in the daytime hours and increases as the day progresses and nighttime approaches. On the other hand, there is a correlation between the hourly pattern of prostitution, kidnapping, and forcible sex offenses, indicating these crimes could potentially be related to or influence one another. These crimes have in common that they would require discretion to proceed unnoticed, which is what the nighttime provides.</p>

The heatmap illustrates 5 concentrations of prostitution, namely in the following SF districts: Tenderloin, Mission, Bayview, Sunset, and Ingleside. The two districts with heavier concentrations are Tenderloin and Mission, while the rest are more sparsely concentrated.

  <p>Prostitution in SF exists predominantly in five areas, visualized by plotting geospatial data on a heatmap of SF. The five areas appear to be the following five districts: Tenderloin, Mission, Bayview, Sunset, and Ingleside. Tenderloin and Mission are the two districts with the higher concentration of prostitution, while the remaining three are more sparsely distributed. An article published in the San Francisco Chronicle on September 9, 2016<cite>[11]</cite> details the historical context behind Tenderloin becoming infamous for various types of crimes, a hub for cultural movements including the fight for LGBT rights, and a haven for many different groups of people, including actors, musicians, bartenders, office workers, and more marginalized groups such as dancers and prostitutes<cite>[12]</cite>. In a similar vein, the Mission district is notorious for being a hub for prostitution, divulged in an article published on June 13, 2016<cite>[13]</cite>, where the ‘longstanding prostitution problem on Shotwell and Capp streets’ was named.Despite a decreasing trend in prostitution, recent news articles from February 2023<cite>[14]</cite> indicate that the ‘Prostitution problem’ is still rampant in the Mission District and that SFPD is actively strategizing through undercover operations, barricades, and crackdowns to mitigate illegal activity on certain streets within the district. A resolution pushing to decriminalize sex work and legalize red-light districts across California was introduced in February 2023<cite>[15]</cite> indicating that the fight for decriminalization is still ongoing.</p>
