  <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Tragic events around the world, such as natural disasters including earthquakes, have large-scale negative infrastructural, environmental, economic, cultural and social consequences. In February 2023, southeast Turkey (officially the Republic of Türkiye) and northwest Syria were hit by powerful earthquakes, causing large-scale loss of human lives and infrastructure, leaving millions of people in urgent need of basic necessities<cite>[1]</cite>. These devastating events became an inspiration for an analysis of the global perception and implications caused by differences in reporting. A subject of interest in the occurrence of tragic events around the world is the world’s reaction to those tragedies. </p>

  <p class="h5">Dataset Overview</p> 
    <p class="h6" style="text-align:justify">The Significant Earthquake Dataset for the period of 1906–2023 is a thorough database of information on noticeable earthquakes that have happened all over the world in the previous 123 years. The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)<cite>[2]</cite> of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)<cite>[3]</cite> is responsible for compiling and maintaining this dataset. To give the most precise and current information on earthquake events, it is frequently updated. Each entry in the dataset contains information about one of the more than 37,000 earthquakes that took place during this time period, including the earthquake's date, time, location, magnitude, and depth.

  </p><br>

  <p>This article deep dives into the reporting and media perception of earthquakes in selected regions of the world. Earthquakes are a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by shifting in the rocks (tectonic plates) deep underneath the earth’s surface<cite>[4]</cite>. For the purpose of assessing the impact of earthquakes in this article, magnitude is used as an objective measure. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), magnitude is the size of the earthquake, determined from data recorded by a seismometer<cite>[5]</cite>.</p>
   
  <p>The Significant Earthquake Dataset was filtered to only include ‘Earthquakes’ and the timeline was filtered to only include data from over the last decade, specifically the years between 2010 and 2023. This would allow for a more recent and pertinent interpretation of the data, assuming a more comparative scope relating to technical advancements in the recording of earthquake incidents. The figure below depicts Earthquake occurrences per year between 2010 and 2023.</p>

<p class="h5">Impact on a country’s GDP and financial Growth</p>
  <p>As we delve into the consequences of earthquakes and expose the devastation and horrors the aftermath brings, it raises the question as to which extent these events affect economic and social dynamics. Some experts declare that it has a significant negative effect on growth, others highlight indirect effects of economic damage. Like spreading through trade networks and supply chains <cite>[23]</cite>. However, something that is agreed upon is that the economic impact not only depends on the destruction they cause but the countries they terrorize. What are their pre-existing economic conditions, which opportunities do the country have to reallocate its resources towards rebuilding communities and reconstruction in general <cite>[24]</cite>.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, poorer economies are more likely to experience larger effects on their country’s financial growth, than those with high economic stability <cite>[25]</cite>. Throughout this section, the exploration of Japan’s and Indonesia’s economic stance as defense against earthquakes will be explored, with support from the USGS dataset and GDP dataset gathered from the World Bank <cite>[26]</cite>. </p>

Top) all earthquakes in general regardless of magnitude. Bottom) Occurrences of earthquakes with magnitude above 6.0. In the past decade Japan and Indonesia have been the leading countries with the highest frequency of earthquakes, also leading with highest magnitude Fig[8]. Japan had 526 occurrences of earthquakes with magnitude above 5.3, while Indonesia reached 543.
</figcaption></span><br>
    </figure>
  </div>
 
  <p>In 2022 alone there were 35 earthquakes with magnitude above 5.3 in Indonesia and 25 in Japan. Since 2011, Indonesia has had a higher number of occurrences of earthquakes than Japan. As those last numbers might seem low, the damage that lower magnitude can cause such as 5.3 and 5.4. still significantly affects the lives of those impacted. A latest example of this is the 5.4 magnitude Earthquake that occurred southeast of Tokyo, Japan, the 11th of may 2023. Four people were injured and rail services were delayed or canceled <cite>[27]</cite>.</p>

  <p>Even though the countries suffer similarly from the dangers of mother nature. The ability to stand guard and recover from disaster seem to differentiate based on economic stability.</p>

 <p>While Indonesia ranks as 39 in the world in terms of GDP growth and has the largest economy in Southeast Asia. Japan is ranked third in the world overall in terms of GDP with a 2.4% growth this year <cite>[28]</cite>. The increase in economic disparity between the two countries can be seen on figure <cite>[11]</cite>, where the the disparity already increases from the 70s.

  <p class="h5">Japan’s Economic rise</p>
  <p>Japan lies in the collision zone of four lithospheric plates and has therefore numerous times been a victim a numerous time to energy that is released from the continuous movement of these plates [29]. Yet, despite being in the center of a seismically active zone, Japan’s economy has thrived and remained remarkably resistant throughout the years. Japan first saw economic growth after World-War two and experienced rapid growth until the early 90s figure Fig[3], </cite>[30]</cite>. This period is called the Japanese Economic miracle <cite>[29]</cite>.</p>

This period now is called the Japanese Economic miracle <cite>[29]</cite>.</p>

  <p>There are four main key factors contributing to their growth, including their effort in technological change, accumulation of capital, increased quantity and quality of labor and increased international trade. Under these four factors, expertise in different fields such as continuous innovation, and financial stability became prominent <cite>[30]</cite>. 
  This period massively contributed to Japan’s economic power that they have today, as well as their favorable government policies [30].
  While Japan was gaining economical strength, they also applied more resources into earthquake research and prevention, as they already  had been studying for years. 
  Such as the earthquake resistance building <cite>[31]</cite>. 
  </p>

  <p>After the 1968 earthquake off the shore of Tokachi, Japan made several revisions to its laws and regulations for earthquake-resistant buildings. These included tighter regulations for reinforced concrete structures, and revision of the  Building Act and Anti-seismic Design Code and Building Standard Act <cite>[31]</cite>. These revisions were almost immediately inplaced after high damaging earthquakes <cite>[31]</cite>. As a result of these efforts into securing buildings and in general investing in Disaster-prevention technologies <cite>[45]</cite>. Japan are able to minimize the degree of material damage. Thereby, decreasing devastating consequences of earthquake and remaining economically robust.</p>

  <p class="h5">Indonesia: Road to the largest economy in southeast Asia.</p>
  <p>Like Japan, Indonesia is a very seismic country. The country lies on the pacific ring of fire, which is the world’s greatest volcanic and seismic belt and at the junction of three major tectonic plates <cite>[32]</cite>. Though their economic growth has happened at a much slower and steadier pace over a few decades as figure <cite>[11]</cite> illustrates. Indonesia made an effort towards their agriculture and their industrial development. By increasingly attracting foreign investment and integrating themselves into the global economy <cite>[33]</cite>.
</p>

  <p>Despite the positive economic growth and Indonesia being a highly earthquake-prone country. The development of more solid, earthquake-resistant facilities has not increased <cite>[32]</cite>. Lack of investment in correct building structure leaves the already weak infrastructure vulnerable to even moderately strong earthquakes. These earthquakes then cause collapse of buildings and horrible loss of lives. A strong earthquake striking a city such as Jakarta, Indonesia or another highly populated city could cause fatal damage unlike anything seen<cite>[33]</cite>. Some blame lack of action towards preventing measures on mismanagement, limited financial resources, a lack of skills, or corruption<cite>[34]</cite>. Whatever the reason, the most vulnerable victims, unfortunately repeatedly, are those living in poverty.</p>
  
  <p>Evident from the economic findings above, earthquakes can amplify existing social disparities and inequalities. Areas with reduced economic resources are disproportionately affected, causing reduced access to healthcare, basic necessities, and financial structures/opportunities due to impact on local business and economy. The collapse of infrastructure causes death, displacement and homelessness, which may disrupt social wellbeing, and have psychological impacts on local communities. These factors may lead to further marginalization of already-marginalized communities.</p>

<p class="h5">Shakes & quakes: Unheard, ignored and indomitable</p> 
<p>Earthquakes can have significant impacts on affected communities. These can include the loss of life and injuries, damage to homes and infrastructure, displacement of people from their homes, and emotional trauma. These impacts can also include changes in social relationships and community dynamics, such as increased cooperation and support among neighbors or a breakdown in social order. Are humans bearing these impacts only because the earthquake is a natural calamity or is there more behind the story? To get an insight into this some of the countries that are affected by high death tolls and damaged infrastructure over the last decade have been explored. According to<cite>[44]</cite>, the experience of various nations in the wake of earthquakes that resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities, and marked as deadliest and costliest earthquakes in history such as earthquakes in Chile, Colombia, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Italy, and Japan, are used in this analysis shown in Fig[5].

  <p>Since 2010-2023 among the above-mentioned countries, Japan, Chile, and Indonesia have had most of the earthquakes compared to the other countries that took place from early morning to midday, shown in Fig[6]. According to<cite>[35]</cite>, the night is the worst time for an earthquake to occur because most people are inside. When farmers are outside and office and factory workers are commuting, the morning and evening hours are when the effects are least severe. However, the 2010 Haiti earthquake<cite>[36]</cite>, and the Japan earthquake in 2011<cite>[37]</cite> took place during the daytime between 14-17 with the magnitude 7.0 - 9.0 and were considered one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Some countries are affected by poorly-built infrastructure, and the reason showed that in Haiti's case, the quality of construction was vastly underestimated by the engineering community. On the other hand, Turkey and Japan both have modern building codes <cite>[38]</cite><cite>[39]</cite>, but even modern building codes do not guarantee zero damage. In 2011, Japan faced an earthquake with the highest magnitude ever recorded in the region and the third-largest in the world since 1900<cite>[40]</cite>. It is reported that a handful of Japanese geologists had begun to recognize that a large earthquake and tsunami would strike in that year but their warnings went unheeded by officials responsible for the country's earthquake hazard assessments, as per Live Science previously reported <cite>[41]</cite>. The recent earthquake in Turkey-Syria 2023<cite>[42]</cite> occurred at 04:17 on February 6 with a 7.8 Magnitude, causing one of the deadliest and costliest earthquakes killing nearly 60,000 people and destroying thousands of buildings, as medical teams and other first responders could not arrive quickly. The difficult weather conditions and freezing temperatures hampered rescue efforts and increased suffering in war-torn Syria<cite>[43]</cite>.</p>

 
  <p class="h5">Global ‘Earthquake’ search patterns using Google Trends</p>
  <p>In order to make comparison easier, the focus is initially on the February 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Evidently, there have been 10 incidents of earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.8 in the years between 2010 and 2023. The earliest recorded in October 2010 in Indonesia, and the latest in February 2023 in Turkey. To gain an initial perspective of the reaction to these earthquake incidents, Google Trends data was explored by analyzing popularity of top search queries<cite>[6]</cite><cite>[7]</cite>. For the keyword ‘Earthquake’ under the category Disaster type the filters ‘Worldwide’, ‘1/1/10-3/31/2023’, ‘All categories’ and ‘Web Search’ were selected<cite>[8]</cite>. The data is visualized in Fig [4].</p>
   
  <p>To interpret the data, Google explains that the numbers represent the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given time and region. This means that ‘100’ is the peak popularity of the term, ‘50’ means the term is half as popular and ‘0’ means there is insufficient data (‘Interest over time’)<cite>[9]</cite>. For February 2023, the value is ‘100’, indicating this was the peak popularity of the search term ‘Earthquake’. Filtering the dataset by the year 2023 and the month of February, there are 27 earthquake incidents, 10 of which have occurred in Turkey. Analyzing regional data for the full timeline, the graph depicts that the value for Turkey is ‘100’, indicating that most searches have occurred in that region. Further analysis, done by isolating the searches specifically in February 2023 show that Turkey has a value of ‘100’, followed by Syria with ‘41’, Lebanon with ‘31’ and Cyprus with ‘31’. This indicates that the spike in February 2023 is attributed mostly to Turkey, and that the peak popularity of the ‘Earthquake’ search term in February 2023 occurred from searches in Turkey and other countries within the region, likely as Turkey was hit the hardest by these earthquakes. Notably, there are 6369 instances of earthquakes between January 2010 and March 2023 with varying (and often higher) magnitudes, but the ‘Earthquake’ keyword is the most searched within Turkey and its surrounding region in February 2023. This coincides with the earthquakes in Turkey, and the large number of missing people and deaths that occurred may have resulted in a collective panic amongst shaken and grieving communities.

  <p class="h5">Analysis of elements in disaster reporting</p>
  <p>In order to analyze the differences in reporting, the two earthquakes with the highest number of searches, namely the earthquakes in Turkey and Japan were compared and analyzed. On February 6, 2023, an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. It was the second strongest earthquake recorded in the history of the country and the largest following the 1939 Erzincan earthquake<cite>[10]</cite> which had the same magnitude. It caused nearly 60,000 deaths, around 50,783 in Turkey and 8,476 in Syria, making it the deadliest natural disaster in the country’s modern history <cite>[11]</cite>. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake of magnitude 9.1 occurred in the Pacific Ocean, 72 km east of the Oshika Peninsula of the Tohoku region in Japan. The earthquake depicted in Fig[9] was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan and the fourth most powerful since modern earthquake record-keeping began in 1900. It also caused tsunami waves, which in turn caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. It caused nearly 20,000 deaths, and large infrastructural damage<cite>[12]</cite>. Fig[10] and Fig[11] below illustrate the earthquake occurrences in the world between 2010 and 2023.

  <p>A wordcloud, depicted in Fig[8]was generated using BBC news article headlines and descriptions using recent data, to gain some insight on the use of words in news article headlines when reporting disasters. ‘Turkey’, ‘Syria’ and ‘Earthquake’ appear frequently, with Turkey appearing more frequently than Syria, likely due to Turkey being the primary location impacted by the earthquake. The next most appearing words are ‘Rescue’, ‘Survivor’ and ‘Rubble’ alluding to the rescue operations and news of survivors that follow in the days following an earthquake. Different categories of words that can be grouped together also appear, ‘Danger’,‘Fear’ and ‘Mourning’ appear, these highlight the emotional reactions and sentiments, typically of the local community. Additionally, words such as ‘Miracles’, ‘Baby’, ‘Newborn’ and ‘Family’ also appear, indicating more personal stories related to the impact and aftermath of the earthquake. There are mentions of ‘Indonesia’, ‘Japan’ and ‘UK’. Indonesia is a country where the occurrence of earthquakes is frequent, and analyzing the data showed that there were many occurrences of earthquakes in 2022, but have not been particularly impactful to garner media attention. Japan may be mentioned due to the country’s history of earthquakes, as well as in articles analyzing long-term damage. The UK was likely mentioned in relation to emergency aid. This analysis shows that news article headlines are mostly factual, with most of the emotional, sentimental and personal elements being drawn from reactions to the devastation caused by the earthquake, stories of ‘miraculous’ rescue and news of emergency aid from the international perspective. The representation of news in article headlines is explored further in the next section.

<p>To ensure that an objective comparison could be made, settings and filters were made identical, with the only difference being in the selected timeline. It is important to note that there may be differences in the results that appear on search engines (in this case Google), and they may be influenced by regional or algorithmic differences, or historical searching habits. On Google News<cite>[13]</cite>, the keywords ‘Japan’ and ‘Turkey’ were searched within the specific months that the earthquakes occurred, and the news articles were sorted by ‘most relevant’.</p>

<p>An article posted on BBC titled ‘Turkey Earthquake: Young girl rescued after 178 hours’<cite>[14]</cite> details progress in rescue operations more than a week after the initial earthquakes. The article also includes mentions of other instances where victims, specifically mothers with babies and young children, are rescued after several days from underneath rubble and debris. This is showcased in the following extracts: ‘Several others were saved on Monday, including a 13-year-old boy trapped for 182 hours’ and ‘In hard-hit Hatay province, 13-year-old Kaan was rescued after being trapped for 182 hours - as well as a woman called Naide Umay, found alive after 175 hours.’<cite>[15]</cite> Highlighting particularly vulnerable segments of the population, and creating a ‘miraculous’ narrative draws viewership and attention to the news. Generating interest for world news can have positive effects, such as increasing awareness and empathy for when disaster strikes, and general worldwide events. Dramatizing stories of tragedy can however have negative consequences. To some extent, it inevitably capitalizes on human suffering even if it is unintentional. Articles published in CNN titled ‘More than 4,300 dead in Turkey and Syria after powerful quake’<cite>[16]</cite>, DW titled ‘Turkey-Syria earthquakes: UN expects death toll above 50,000’ and DR (translated from danish)‘More than 20,000 are dead and missing in Japan’ <cite>[17]</cite> indicate that death tolls are presented factually, and observing a wide range of similar news articles, in a systematic fashion and layout. This depicts that in the reporting process, there is the inevitable representation of the loss of human life as a purely quantitative measure. Evidently, it is necessary to report on all worldwide news, despite the deeply tragic denotation of numbers like death tolls. However, increased exposure to such information, and increased exposure to news of death or tragedy can cause desensitization in the longer term. Dr. Diana Concannon, a licensed psychologist and crisis response expert states that in disaster psychology, the desensitization to death (or on-going threats) is a survival mechanism, and that the brain adapts to persistent adversity and can keep functioning <cite>[18]</cite>. This means that continued exposure to devastating news may decrease the emotional impact of the news, and instead increase apathy.
</p>

<p>An additional insight in this regard is that when certain areas/regions of the world (in this case Syria) are impacted by different forms of social, financial or political instability (for which there can be many causes), this is widely reported on as part of international news. When natural disaster or tragedy additionally strikes such places, and the news of this is dramatized in international news, it may lead to a decreased sense of empathy and desensitization towards death in those areas. In addition to this, some areas of the world more prone to earthquakes (or other natural disasters) due to their geographical location on fault lines/tectonic plates<cite>[19]</cite> may be disproportionately reported leading to desensitization from the world’s perspective. It is also relevant to note that news sites may be biased, either due to political, nationalistic or financial affiliations. A research article published in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management highlights the detrimental effects of sensationalist media reporting of disasters on the affected destination, specifically that there may be large tourism-related losses for the economy <cite>[20]</cite>.
</p>

<p>When reporting earthquake incidents, there is also a sensationalizing of the news which is observed. In the following article by CNN <cite>[21]</cite> the adjectives ‘powerful’, ‘tremendous’ and ‘enormous’ were used. Phrases such as ‘...the earth continued to twitch with aftershocks…’, ‘Buildings shook, heaved and collapsed by the score…’, ‘...plumes of white smoke emanating…’ and ‘Scores of aftershocks jarred the country…’ were used to describe the earthquake and its impact. It can be suggested that such descriptions are necessary to express the entirety of the damage that has been done when reporting natural disasters. However, when reporting of local events is exaggerated, both in local and global media, it might shape the perspective of events, exhibiting both positive and negative aspects. For example, it may incite unnecessary panic, fear and misconceptions in local audiences, having a negative impact on mental health and emotional wellbeing. It might incite empathy around the world, but might also negatively impact the global image of a certain place. Reporting that emphasizes the severity and impact of incidents in a certain location might also influence the distribution of emergency aid and other resources in relation to the actual damage. An article published in Reporter Magazine <cite>[22]</cite> explores sensationalism in media, suggesting that sensationalist headlines are popular as journalists and media publications stand to benefit financially from increased viewership in published content, and often compromise accuracy to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Prostitution in SF exists predominantly in five areas, visualized by plotting geospatial data on a heatmap of SF. The five areas appear to be the following five districts: Tenderloin, Mission, Bayview, Sunset, and Ingleside. Tenderloin and Mission are the two districts with the higher concentration of prostitution, while the remaining three are more sparsely distributed. An article published in the San Francisco Chronicle on September 9, 2016<cite>[11]</cite> details the historical context behind Tenderloin becoming infamous for various types of crimes, a hub for cultural movements including the fight for LGBT rights, and a haven for many different groups of people, including actors, musicians, bartenders, office workers, and more marginalized groups such as dancers and prostitutes<cite>[12]</cite>. In a similar vein, the Mission district is notorious for being a hub for prostitution, divulged in an article published on June 13, 2016<cite>[13]</cite>, where the ‘longstanding prostitution problem on Shotwell and Capp streets’ was named.Despite a decreasing trend in prostitution, recent news articles from February 2023<cite>[14]</cite> indicate that the ‘Prostitution problem’ is still rampant in the Mission District and that SFPD is actively strategizing through undercover operations, barricades, and crackdowns to mitigate illegal activity on certain streets within the district. A resolution pushing to decriminalize sex work and legalize red-light districts across California was introduced in February 2023<cite>[15]</cite> indicating that the fight for decriminalization is still ongoing.</p>
